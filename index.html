<h2>Have you ever thought, What would happen if the planet ran out of energy? we do, but instead of asking ourselves that we have to think. How can I save energy in my house?
    Research has demonstrated that humans tend to depend on all sources of energy for everything we do..All this time we have overused energy such as electricity, fossil fuels and combustion. These are the most used, but sadly the most polluting (especially fossil fuels).
    For that reason as a team we have decided that even though we don’t have the possibility to stop using fossil fuels in our houses and neighborhoods, we can make a campaign by using a website to inform people on how we can reduce energy consumption in our houses.

    First of all what you can do to reduce energy turn off your computer if your not using it, for example if you are working in your laptop but then you have to take your dog for a walk but you didnt turn off your computer and everytime you take your dog for a walk you leave it on you are using a lot of energy you were just wasting energy for free.
    
    Another thing you can do is to turn off the light if you are not in the room and use LED bulbs. This bulb uses 75% less energy than a normal bulb.
